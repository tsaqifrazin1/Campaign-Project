# Campaign
A decentralized campaign contribution and management system built using Solidity, Web3.js and React. The system allows multiple contributors to contribute to a campaign and allows the campaign manager to create requests for funds and have them approved by the contributors. The system also allows the contributors to withdraw their funds at any given time.
